# linio-printnumber-challenge

# Challenge â€“Backend Developer

Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for
multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Linio". For multiples of 5 print
"IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Linianos".

But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary
operators or `else`.

# Requirements
* 1 if
* You can't use `else`, `else if` or ternary
* Unit tests
* Feel free to apply your SOLID knowledge

# Run program

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="mx.com.linio.printnumbers.App"
